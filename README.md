This is one of many other READ-ME' s.
The main objective of this one is to make sure I got the right reposistory, and it's also a good software development practice, as well.
Might as well write what I need:

Bootstrap;
Flexbox;
2PJS (framework for SwiperJS)

It will take me some hours to learn each, currently I'm learning Flexbox.
Bootstrap I used to be familiar with a year ago but I kinda forgot now, never really worked with 2pjs up until now
